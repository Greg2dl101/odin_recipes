  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This is a simple dish that's great when you need something in your stomach for lunch! This particular recipe is pretty high in calories (particularly from fat), but you can use lower calorie bread, cheese, and leaner ham to cut calories and turn it into a satisfying, high-protien meal if you choose to!</p>
